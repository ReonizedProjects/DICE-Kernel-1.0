# DICE-Kernel-1.0:
A Kernel built off of the GNU/Linux Drivers and Other things.

# CREDIT:

Linus Torvalds (Linux Drivers) (https://kernel.org)
GNU Foundation (other stuff used in linux) (https://gnu.org, https://fsf.org)

# ABOUT:

The DICE kernel is a kernel based off of GNU/Linux 6.6. Written in Rust and C#, this kernel uses some attributes (the entire /drivers/ directory from linux 😢)
the Terminal included is written in Python and is absolutely terrible and can only Git Clone and some other stuffs.


# ALSO:

Im probably not gonna finish this before I graduate into High School, as such, I leave this to any whom want to edit and help with it.

# Thanks!:

Thank You for using the DICE kernel!
